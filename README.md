# Background

2022 Advent of Code looked like a fun little project, logging my progress in this repo.

Note that I'm typically solving challenges interactively in an `ipython` REPL, and then
cleaning up the history to get a consistent file in post. The workflow looks like this:

1. Launch an `ipython` REPL and solve the challenge iteratively
2. Write out the sesion history with `%history -f history.py`
3. Clean up the history file to remove non-working lines, and restructure/reorder as needed
